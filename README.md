# Neo4jUserBundle
Use Neo4j as a database with FOSUserBundle

Citation: Most of the code was written by Christophe Willemsen (https://github.com/ikwattro) in his repositories: https://github.com/ikwattro/Neo4jUserBundle and https://github.com/ikwattro/KwattroNeo4jOGMBundle
I adjusted the code to better fit my needs.

Caution: This does not work yet. Work is in progress.

Goals: 
- Have a bundle which works out of the box to allow FOSUserBundle to use Neo4j as the storage and which can be fully configured in the app/config/config.yml file. 
- Allow easy manipulation of registration/login forms and entitys
